      <h5>CASTLIGHT’S CARE GUIDANCE SITES</h5>
      <br>
      <p>Castlight’s Care Guidance Sites provide services only to users based in the United States.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Personal Information We Collect</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>Castlight collects Personal Information about you from both you and others at several points in our provision of service through the Care Guidance Sites.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Information Requests</u> . When you request more information about our services provided through the Care Guidance Sites prior to registering, you will be required to provide Personal Information (such as your name and email address) so we can connect with you to provide information you seek.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Pre-Registration</u> . You may be pre-registered for Castlight by a health plan sponsored by an Employer (i.e. the specific Castlight Companies’ customer who authorized your access to the applicable Sites), or such health plan’s third-party administrator, which may include, administrators for medical, dental, pharmacy, and behavioral health services (“ TPAs”). The pre-registration process requires the collection of Personal Information about you (for example, name and email address). Your health plan may provide (or may have its TPAs provide) additional information such as a unique identifier (for example, social security numbers or employee IDs). This information is used by Castlight to securely verify your identity to set up your account for the Care Guidance Sites.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Registration</u> . We require the collection of Personal Information as part of the registration process (for example, name, email address, home zip code, birth date, some of which may be provided by your health plan or its TPAs to Castlight). You may provide additional information, some of which may be Personal Information (for example, health plan, health plan subscriber ID number, the name of your physician, email address, home phone number, and home address). We encourage you to provide this information to enable optimal use of the Care Guidance Service. In many cases, you will be asked to enter this information directly. In other cases, that information may be pre-filled if we have already received such information from your health plan (either directly or through its TPAs). If you arrive at the Care Guidance Sites directly, the registration process requires you to choose a unique identifier (for example, username and password) for your account for the Care Guidance Sites. If you arrive at the Care Guidance Sites through an Employer or Employer designated website, such website may provide a unique identifier that confirms to Castlight that you are an authorized member from such Employer or Employer designated website.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Communications</u> . The purpose of the services we provide via the Care Guidance Sites is to provide you with the ability to understand, analyze and better organize your healthcare and related financial information. Castlight records and maintains certain communications (for example, emails and other communications with Castlight). Castlight considers these communications to be personal and private and unless your explicitly agree to additional use and disclosure of such communications, will not use or disclose these communications except as provided for in this Privacy Statement.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Health Plan Related Information</u> . Your health plan (either directly or through its TPAs) may provide Castlight with, or Castlight may otherwise access and collect from such parties, healthcare financial information or other information about you for Castlight to provide our services via the Care Guidance Sites and only for that purpose. This may include sharing of information about you via integration between the service provided via the Care Guidance Sites and certain systems used by you and by your health plan or its TPAs containing information about you. The provision and sharing of this information is optional by your health plan or its TPAs and they may require you to provide them with certain consents.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Payor Information</u> . Castlight may request and collect financial information and relevant health plan or other payor information from you.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Device and OS Version</u> . When you download and use Castlight Mobile, we collect information on the type of device you use and operating system version.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Log Files</u> . As with most websites, Castlight automatically collects and stores in log files the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer you are using, the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the browser software you use and your operating system, the date and time you access the service, and the Internet address of the website from which you directly linked to Castlight. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. Castlight uses this log file information to analyze trends, administer the service, and monitor service traffic and usage patterns for internal security purposes and to help make the Castlight service more useful.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Other Information You May Share</u> . In your access and use of the services provided via the Care Guidance Sites, you may share information with Castlight (such as search terms or information regarding your health care provider) which we may retain and display in your account for the Care Guidance Sites. We may also collect your location-based information (i.e. your name, IP address, email, physical address, and/or other data that may enable someone to personally identify you) for the purpose of enforcing the Terms of Use and to provide our services via the Care Guidance Sites. Locator information is your name, email, physical address, IP address and/or other data that enables someone to personally identify you. Castlight and your Internet Access Provider may use locator information as is necessary to enforce the Castlight Companies’ Terms of Use.
        </li>
